 Fashion design is the art of applying design, aesthetic and natural beauty to clothing and 
 its accessories. It is influenced by cultural and social attitudes, and has varied over time and place.
 Fashion designers work in a number of ways in designing clothing and accessories.
 Because of the time required to bring a garment into the market, designers must at time anticipate changes to consumer tastes.
 Designers conduct research on fashion trends and interpret them for their audience.
 Their specific designs are used by manufacturers. This is the assence of a designer'role; however, there is variation  
 within this that is determined by buying and merchandising approach, and product quality; for example, budget retailers will use 
 inexpensive fabrics to interpret trends, but high-end retailers will ensure that the best available fabrics are used.
