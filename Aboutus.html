 Fashion design is the art of applying design, aesthetic<br>
 and natural beauty to clothing and its accessories.<br>
 It is influenced by cultural and social attitudes,<br>
 and has varied over time and place.<br>
 Fashion designers work in a number of ways in designing <br>
 clothing and accessories.<br>
 Because of the time required to bring a garment into<br> 
 the market, designers<br>
 must at time anticipate changes to consumer tastes.<br>
 Designers conduct research on fashion trends and <br>
 interpret them for their audience.<br>
 Their specific designs are used by manufacturers.<br>
 This is the assence of a designer'role; <br>
 however, there is variation  <br>
 within this that is determined by buying and<br>
 merchandising approach, and product quality;<br>
 for example, budget retailers will use <br>
 inexpensive fabrics to interpret trends,<br>
 but high-end retailers will ensure that<br>
 the best available fabrics are used.
